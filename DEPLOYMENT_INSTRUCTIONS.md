## 🌐 Domain Setup Instructions for Cloudshare

### DNS Configuration Required:
You need to configure these DNS records with Cloudshare for `aijobchommie.co.za`:

#### A Records (Apex Domain @):
```
Type: A
Name: @
Value: 185.199.108.153

Type: A  
Name: @
Value: 185.199.109.153

Type: A
Name: @  
Value: 185.199.110.153

Type: A
Name: @
Value: 185.199.111.153
```

#### CNAME Record (WWW Subdomain):
```
Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: fernandosteyn.github.io
```

## 🚀 Deployment Options

### Option 1: Automatic Deployment via GitHub Actions (Recommended)
Your repository already has GitHub Actions configured. It will automatically deploy when you:

1. **Enable GitHub Pages:**
   - Go to https://github.com/FernandoSteyn/aijobchommie-website
   - Go to Settings → Pages
   - Source: "GitHub Actions"
   - The workflow will automatically run on pushes to the current branch

2. **Custom Domain Configuration:**
   - In Settings → Pages → Custom domain
   - Enter: `aijobchommie.co.za`
   - Click "Save"
   - Wait for DNS check to pass (may take a few minutes after DNS setup)

### Option 2: Manual Deployment via gh-pages
If you prefer manual deployment:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

Note: This may fail on Windows due to long path names, so Option 1 is recommended.

## 🔧 Post-Deployment Steps

### 1. Verify Deployment
- Visit https://aijobchommie.co.za (after DNS propagation)
- Check all pages load correctly
- Test responsive design on mobile devices

### 2. SSL Certificate
GitHub Pages automatically provides SSL certificates for custom domains. After DNS setup:
- Certificate will be automatically issued
- Site will be accessible via HTTPS
- HTTP will redirect to HTTPS

### 3. DNS Propagation Time
- DNS changes can take 4-48 hours to fully propagate
- Use tools like https://dnschecker.org to monitor progress
- Initially test using https://fernandosteyn.github.io/aijobchommie-website
